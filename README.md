# Oscilloscope-Test

Might have been better to call it a "Strip recorder".. 

Works OK as a slow speed visual display. but is very limited for fast signals. 
Has good digital scales input
now has two digital inputs (be careful not to exceed 3.3v!


Modifications to dEEbugger To make a more universal Oscilloscope: Aiming for ESP32
Named Oscilloscope-Test for now
small updates in progess
